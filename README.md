# cra-typescript-template by [Colby M. White]

This is my preferred starting template for a create-react-app project with what I consider a sane set of starting settings.

It contains the following:
- Basic "Hello, World" page
- Sane yarn scripts
- `material-ui` components
- CSS Reset via `CssBaseline`
